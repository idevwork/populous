# Populous Web Admin

This is the admin ui for the
[Populous web application](https://github.com/bitpopulous/platform).
It is built using the [Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com) node framework for
the backend and build system, and
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) on the front-end.

## Development setup

The setup for the admin app is just like the
[public app](https://github.com/bitpopulous/platform).
To get up and running please read the docs in that repo.

Note: This admin app expects the `platform` server to be running
in another tab (as it connects to the same DB).
